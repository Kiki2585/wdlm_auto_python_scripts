# wdlm_auto_python_scripts
This is built for Windows
I was bored of opening 4 clients and logging into it. So, I made a script for me. 
It also renames your window according to the name you provide in "account_names.txt"

How Does it work: ( Script assumes your password is the same for all accounts and omits the password input. Can be added soon if needed. )

1. Put your wdlm's .exe file in the filepath
2. Put your info into "account_names.txt" with the following format:
   
  window_name_you_wanna_have account_name
  
and it does the rest. you can add more if needed.

2. you can also add other keys to get more named windows and more accounts.
